1. I2C Communication Protocol
What is I2C?
I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a two-wire, synchronous serial communication protocol used to connect multiple peripherals to microcontrollers.

Uses two lines: SDA (Serial Data) and SCL (Serial Clock).

One device acts as a controller (master), others as targets (slaves).

Each device has a unique address.
